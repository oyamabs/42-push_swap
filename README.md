# Bonus part

Make a checker program that checks if the stacks are sorted or not.

# Thoughts on the project

That project was really hard, but it made me think about efficiency more than the other projects so far.

The real downside I think is that the bonus is really really easy to make as you just need to read from the standard input, execute the instructions and check if the stack is sorted or not. I got to reuse a lot of the code I made for the mandatory part.
